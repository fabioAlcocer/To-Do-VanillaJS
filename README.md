## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/) - For styles and components

### What I learned

This is my first project with Chakra and I love all the things you can do with it. It totally changes the way that you can style components, making the code a lot cleaner.
